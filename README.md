# Bunny Defense
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Stenodyon/bunny_defense.svg?branch=network)](https://travis-ci.org/Stenodyon/bunny_defense)

This game was a software engineering project assignment. It is now open source
and sparsely developped and maintained by the three-person team it originated
from. It is a tower defense where you need to defend against killer bunnies.

## Warning

Placing towers during the wave is still experimental and can throw harmless
exceptions.

```bash
make
